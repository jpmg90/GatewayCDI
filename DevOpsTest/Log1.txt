Schannel System Log:

It looks as though the browser the user is using to access the website does not have the proper ciphers that are accepted by the webserver

It looks to be related to TLS 1.2 and thus sha512 is not supported, work around can be put into place if it's needed by the environment.

To non-Technical Staff: It looks as though a Browser attempted to access the server through SSL, which is a more secure way to access, 
but the server didn't accepted it because the browsers security wasn't good enough.
