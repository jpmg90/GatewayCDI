Application Log

Looks as though there's an Unhandled Exception on the GoogleMerchandiseStore application, which is a website running under 
a Network Service Application pool.

The exception in question is: Unknown Web method undefined, which looks to be an issue with an Ajax call.
Looking at the Request URL provided it looks as though the Javascript/Jquery is trying to run an Ajax call on 
https://www.googlemerchandisestore.com:443/shop.aspx/undefined?type=promotion&data=undefined which means there's a jquery/javascript 
function/call that is attempting to read something off the page for a URL and is failing and then attempting to run that request though Ajax
to get back some data.

I would go about fixing it by reviewing the jquery call to see which is pulling undefined data and putting in a check or returning out of the function 
without trying to make the Ajax call. I would then test by finding the page in question that call the Jquery/javascript and debug the browser and 
review the logs to ensure the exception is no longer thrown.

To non-Technical staff: It looks as though one of the fucntions on the site is trying to access a page that doesn't exist and is failing.
